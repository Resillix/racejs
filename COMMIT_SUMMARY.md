# RaceJS Framework - Repository Cleanup Summary

**Date:** October 19, 2025
**Branch:** master
**Commits:** 3 new commits (9618f18a → ac54c8a9)

## Overview

Successfully sanitized and organized the RaceJS framework repository for a clean, production-ready state. Legacy development documentation, planning materials, and experimental examples have been archived while maintaining git history.

## Changes Made

### 1. Archive Structure Created

- **27 files** moved to `/archive/` directory
- **10,285 lines** of historical content preserved
- All moves preserve git history for future reference

### 2. Archived Content

#### Documentation (`archive/docs/`)

- Development implementation plans and progress tracking
- WebSocket integration documentation (legacy)
- Storage system documentation (internal dev notes)
- Phase reports and stability fixes
- Developer workflow examples

#### Examples (`archive/examples/`)

- Heavy dev-mode test results and demos
- Phase completion reports
- Internal demo documentation

#### Planning (`archive/plan/`)

- Original project roadmaps and analysis
- Development research documents
- Feature planning materials

#### Packages (`archive/packages/`)

- Internal storage fix plans

### 3. Maintenance Tooling Added

**Script:** `scripts/prepare-commit-archive.sh`

- Idempotent archive script with dry-run mode
- Preserves git history using `git mv` where possible
- Safe preview before applying changes

**Documentation:** `docs/ARCHIVE_NOTICE.md`

- Clear explanation of archive rationale
- Instructions for restoring archived content
- Git history preservation guidance

### 4. Repository Configuration

**Updated `.gitignore`:**

- Cleaned and deduplicated entries
- Archive directory is **tracked** (intentionally not ignored)
- Proper ignores for:
  - Node/npm artifacts
  - Coverage reports
  - Editor/IDE files
  - `.racejs/` development data
  - Legacy docs still present in tree

## Commit History

```
ac54c8a9 docs: finalize archive notice with clear formatting
b47ce5a7 chore(archive): fix plan dir move to avoid archive/plan/plan; clean .gitignore (keep archive tracked)
9618f18a chore(docs): archive legacy dev-mode docs & heavy examples; add archive notice and prepare-commit script; update .gitignore
```

## Repository Structure (Current)

### Clean Production Tree

```
/docs                  # Curated production documentation
/examples              # Working, maintained examples
/packages              # Core framework code
  /compat              # Express compatibility layer
  /core                # Core RaceJS implementation
/scripts               # Maintenance and build scripts
/test                  # Framework test suite
```

### Archive (Tracked but Separated)

```
/archive
  /docs                # Historical development docs
  /examples            # Legacy demos and test results
  /packages            # Internal dev plans
  /plan                # Original planning materials
```

## Benefits

✅ **Clean main tree** - Easy navigation for new contributors
✅ **Preserved history** - All content accessible in archive
✅ **Reproducible** - Script can be rerun if needed
✅ **Documented** - Clear notices explain what/why/how
✅ **Professional** - Production-ready repository structure

## Remaining Work Items

The following changes are **unstaged** and can be committed separately:

- Modified source files in `/packages/core/src/`
- Updated build artifacts in `/packages/core/dist/`
- New error handling example in `/examples/08-error-handling/`
- Updated hot-reload examples
- Test files for new features

These represent active development work and should be committed with appropriate feature/fix messages.

## Next Steps

1. **Push to master:** `git push origin master`
2. **Review remaining changes:** `git status`
3. **Commit active work:** Stage and commit feature changes separately
4. **Tag release:** Consider tagging a clean release version

## Notes

- Archive content is searchable and accessible
- Git history preserved for all archived files
- Script can archive additional content as needed
- `.gitignore` prevents archive from being ignored
- Framework functionality is **not affected** by this cleanup

---

**Summary:** Repository successfully sanitized with 27 legacy files archived, maintenance tooling added, and clean structure established. Ready for production commits and releases.
