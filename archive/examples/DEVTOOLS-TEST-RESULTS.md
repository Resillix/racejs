- ✅ Multiple simultaneous connections supported
- ✅ Connection events logged correctly
- ✅ Disconnection handling works properly

### 3. **Message Protocol**

- ✅ HELLO message exchange successful
- ✅ CONNECTED response includes version and features
- ✅ GET_METRICS returns current metrics
- ✅ GET_REQUESTS returns recorded requests
- ✅ GET_ROUTES returns routes list
- ✅ Error handling for invalid messages

### 4. **Real-Time Updates**

- ✅ Metrics broadcast every 5 seconds
- ✅ REQUEST_RECORDED events fire when requests captured
- ✅ REQUEST_RESPONSE events fire when responses completed
- ✅ All connected clients receive broadcasts

### 5. **Data Accuracy**

- ✅ Request count tracking accurate
- ✅ Error count tracking accurate

## 🏗️ Architecture Verified

### Components Tested

1. **devtools-server.ts** - WebSocket server ✅
2. **devtools-protocol.ts** - Message types ✅
3. **devtools-handler.ts** - Message processing ✅
4. **manager.ts** - DevModeManager integration ✅

### Event Flow

```
HTTP Request → Application
     ↓
RequestRecorder.recordRequest()
     ↓
DevToolsHandler (via EventEmitter)
     ↓
DevToolsServer.broadcast()
     ↓
All Connected Clients
```

## 🚀 Ready for Next Phase

The WebSocket backend is production-ready and fully tested. We can now proceed with building the HTML/CSS/JS dashboard UI that will connect to this WebSocket server and provide a beautiful visual interface.

### Next Steps:

1. Create embedded HTML/CSS/JS UI
2. Add HTTP server to serve the UI
3. Implement browser-based dashboard with tabs
4. Add charts and visualizations
5. Complete documentation
