Plan: Introduce Dev Mode to RaceJS
Overview
Add a comprehensive devMode feature that provides enhanced developer experience with:
Structured logging system (replacing scattered console.log statements)
Dev-specific features (detailed error messages, route inspection, performance metrics)
Configurable dev mode settings in AppOptions
Better separation between production and development behavior
Changes to Implement
1. Create Dev Logger Module (packages/core/src/dev/logger.ts)
Structured logger with log levels (debug, info, warn, error)
Colorized output with emojis (only in dev mode)
Configurable verbosity levels
Performance timing utilities
Pretty error formatting
2. Create Dev Tools Module (packages/core/src/dev/tools.ts)
Route inspector (list all registered routes)
Request/response debugger
Performance monitor (track request timing, memory usage)
Dev-only endpoints (/_dev/routes, /_dev/health, /_dev/stats)
Middleware stack visualizer
3. Update Application Interface (packages/core/src/application.ts)
Add devMode option to AppOptions:
interface AppOptions {
  devMode?: boolean | DevModeOptions;
  // ... existing options
}

interface DevModeOptions {
  enabled?: boolean;
  verbose?: boolean;
  logLevel?: 'debug' | 'info' | 'warn' | 'error';
  enableDevEndpoints?: boolean;
  trackPerformance?: boolean;
  prettyErrors?: boolean;
}
Replace console.log statements with structured logger
Auto-enable devMode when NODE_ENV !== 'production'
Add dev-specific error handlers with detailed stack traces
4. Update Hot Reload Manager (packages/core/src/hot-reload/manager.ts)
Use dev logger instead of console statements
Add performance tracking for reload operations
Enhance error reporting with file context
5. Update Index Exports (packages/core/src/index.ts)
Export dev logger and tools for user access
Export DevModeOptions type
6. Create Dev Mode Example (examples/08-dev-mode/)
Demonstrate dev mode features
Show how to configure different verbosity levels
Show dev endpoints usage
Compare dev vs production behavior
7. Update Documentation
Add dev mode section to main README
Create dev mode guide (docs/guides/DEV-MODE.md)
Update package.json with dev mode keywords
Benefits
✅ Better developer experience with structured logging
✅ Easier debugging with dev endpoints and tools
✅ Configurable verbosity (no more console.log noise)
✅ Performance insights during development
✅ Clean separation of dev/production code
✅ Maintains backwards compatibility (auto-enables in dev)




You are a senior backend developer and DevOps expert specializing in Node.js/Express applications. You will help improve the stability and user experience of a backend framework.

Here is the current setup and implementation:

<current_setup>
{{CURRENT_SETUP}}
</current_setup>

Here are the specific requirements and goals:

<requirements>
{{REQUIREMENTS}}
</requirements>

Your task is to analyze the current setup and provide comprehensive recommendations to achieve a very stable and extremely smooth user experience.

<scratchpad>
Use this space to think through:
- Current architecture strengths and potential issues
- Hot reloading implementation analysis
- Development vs production considerations
- Performance bottlenecks and stability risks
- User experience pain points
- Priority of different improvements
</scratchpad>

Focus your analysis on these key areas:
1. **Stability Improvements**: Identify potential failure points, error handling gaps, memory leaks, and reliability issues
2. **Performance Optimization**: Analyze response times, resource usage, caching strategies, and scalability concerns
3. **Development Experience**: Evaluate hot reloading efficiency, build times, debugging capabilities, and developer workflow
4. **Production Readiness**: Consider monitoring, logging, graceful shutdowns, health checks, and deployment strategies
5. **User Experience**: Assess API response consistency, error messaging, rate limiting, and overall smoothness

For each recommendation, provide:
- Clear explanation of the issue or improvement opportunity
- Specific implementation steps or code examples where helpful
- Expected impact on stability and user experience
- Priority level (High/Medium/Low)
- Any potential trade-offs or considerations

Structure your response with clear sections for each focus area. Prioritize recommendations that will have the highest impact on stability and user experience smoothness.

Your final response should contain only your analysis and recommendations - do not repeat the scratchpad content in your final answer.
