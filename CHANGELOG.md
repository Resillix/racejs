## Version History

### Semantic Versioning

RaceJS follows semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH):

- **MAJOR** - Incompatible API changes
- **MINOR** - New functionality (backward-compatible)
- **PATCH** - Bug fixes (backward-compatible)

### Release Types

- **Stable** - Production-ready releases (1.x.x)
- **Beta** - Feature-complete, testing phase (1.x.x-beta.x)
- **Alpha** - Early development, unstable (1.x.x-alpha.x)

## Migration Notes

### Upgrading to Hot Reload Version

**No breaking changes!** Hot reload is opt-in via auto-detection:

```javascript
// Before (still works)
const { createApp } = require('@racejs/core');
const app = createApp();

// After (hot reload auto-enabled in development)
const { createApp } = require('@racejs/core');
const app = createApp(); // That's it! Hot reload works automatically
```

To disable hot reload:

```javascript
const app = createApp({ hotReload: false });
```

### New Dependencies

**Optional:**

- `@parcel/watcher` - Native file watcher (recommended for best performance)

If not installed, RaceJS automatically falls back to Node.js `fs.watch`.
